# Stardew Valley Saves Manager

A simple manager for Stardew Valley saves, allowing you to easily backup, delete, or move saves from both Steam and your Android device.

## Overview

This saves manager for Stardew Valley simplifies gameplay across Steam and Android versions of the game by enabling quick transfer of saves between devices.

## Requirements

### Windows:

- This program was written in Java, to run it, you will need to download [OpenJDK.](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-21-x64-windows-jdk.msi)

### Android:

The following steps are necessary to access the Stardew Valley saves folder on your device and interact with it:

- Make sure you have [Stardew Valley](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley&hl=en_US&gl=US) exclusively from Google Play Store.
- Enable *Developer Options* on your device.

## Additional Information

- If you accidentally delete a save, this program **automatically backs up** your Steam saves every time you open it. You can find your saves in the *SteamSavesBackup* folder, where Stardew Valley Saves Manager is installed.
- I made this because I play my Stardew Valley saves on Windows and Android, and it's really complicated to transfer saves. It's a really basic program written in Java, but it will keep receiving updates in the future.
